# Web service - Protect main branch automatically upon repository creation

### How does this work

This web service listens to GitHub organization's webhook for new repository creation and calls GitHub APIs to protect the main branch and create an issue and mention the user.

As soon as GH webhook sends event to web service telling that a new repository is created, the web services calls 2 GH APIs:

1. Repository protection branch API to protect main branch
2. Issue API by creating a new issue and mention the user in the issue comment

If these calls are successful it returns http code 200 otherwise resonds with 4xx or 5xx code.

#### Web service security

To ensure API calls are initiated from GH webhook, the web service verifies request payload using HMAC,SHA-256 and webhook secrets to authenticate messages.

The security can be expanded by whitelisting requests coming from GitHub IPs, list of GH IPs can be obtained from https://api.github.com/meta (this is not included in this implementation)

### How to run the web service

#### 1. Requirements

To run the web service, you need to have followings

* A GitHub organization and a user with role=owner in the organization
* A public IP/url, this allows webhook to reach out to web service
  Â  * If you do not have a server with public IP, you can install and run '[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)' in local computer
* Installed Docker in your server

#### 2. Create GitHub personal Access token

To access to GihHub APIs you need personal access token (PAT), please refer to [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

#### 3. Configure Webhook + secret

You can create a new webhook under GH organization and point it to web service access url. By default this web service listens to route '/' on port 5000, for instance if you run ngrok the API can be accessed via randomly generated url, here the url I got from ngrok 'https://7dff5d84c1.ngrok.io:5000/' you will get a different url.

#### 4. Configure system environment variables

For keeping sensitive information such as secrets and Github token we store them as environment variables. These variables can be sent when you start a docker container. Here is list of variables:

> 1. FLASK_APP=listener.py (allways value is listener.py)
> 2. USER="your-gh-username"
> 3. WH_SECRET="your webhook secret"
> 4. GH_TOKEN="Your GH personal access token"

#### 5. Docker image

You can pull docker image from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) which I created before or build one locally. To build a docker image in local computer you can clone this repository navigate to root directory and run following command and replace docker image name in section #6 with new image name

```apache
docker build -t <your-docker-image-name> .
```

#### 6. Run docker image

To start docker image with default configurations, run

```apache
docker run -d \
            -e GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN} \
            -e USER=${USER}  \
            -e WH_SECRET=${WH_SECRET} \
            -p 5000:5000 \
            --name protect_main_branch \
            ghcr.io/zettayottaorg/task
```

To start docker image with customized configurations,

* Create a new directory called configs and add 2 files
  * config.ini
  * branch_config.json
* You can map local configs directory to /apps/configs in docker container

To start docker, run

```apache
docker run -d \
            -e GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN} \
            -e USER=${USER}  \
            -e WH_SECRET=${WH_SECRET} \
            -p 5000:5000 \
            -v /tmp/configs:/apps/configs \
            --name protect_main_branch \
            ghcr.io/zettayottaorg/task
```

Sample of config.ini

```apache
[DEFAULT]
api_url = https://api.github.com
```

Sample of branch_config.json

```apache
{
    "required_status_checks": null,
    "enforce_admins": null,
    "required_pull_request_reviews" : {
        "dismissal_restrictions": {},      
        "require_code_owner_reviews": true,
        "dismiss_stale_reviews": false,
        "required_approving_review_count": 1
    },
    "restrictions": null
}
```
