# Web service - Protect main branch automatically upon repository creation

### How does this work

This web service listens to GitHub organization's webhook events and calls GitHub API to protect the main branch after a new repository has been created.

As soon as GH webhook sends event to web service indicating a new repository is created, the web services calls 2 GH APIs:

1. Repository protection branch API to protect main branch
2. Issue API by creating a new issue and mention the user in the issue comment

If these calls are successful it returns http code 200.

#### Web service security

To ensure API calls are initiated from GH webhook, the web service verifies payload using HMAC,SHA-256 and webhook secrets to authenticate messages.

This function can be expanded by whitelisting requests coming from GitHub IPs, list of GH IPs can be obtained from https://api.github.com/meta

### How to run the web service

#### 1. Requirements

To run the web service, you need to have followings

* A GitHub organization and a user with role=owner in the organization
* A public IP/url, this allows web service connect to webhook
Â  * If you do not have a server with public IP, you can install and run '[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)' in local computer
* Installed Docker in your server

#### 2. Create GitHub personal Access token

To access to GihHub APIs you need personal access token (PAT), please refer to [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

#### 3. Configure Webhook + secret

You can create a new webhook under GH organization and point it to web service access url. By default this web service listens to route '/' on port 5000, for instance if you run ngrok the API can be accessed via randomly generated url, here the url I got from ngrok 'https://7dff5d84c1.ngrok.io:5000/' you will get a different url.

#### 4. Configure system environment variables

To maintain security, web service uses 4 environment variables. These variables can be sent when you start a docker container. Here is list of variables:

> 1. FLASK_APP=listener.py (allways value is listener.py)
> 2. USER="your-gh-username"
> 3. WH_SECRET="your webhook secret"
> 4. GH_TOKEN="Your GH personal access token"

#### 5. Run docker image

To start docker image with default configurations, run

```apache
docker run -d \
            -e GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN} \
            -e USER=${USER}  \
            -e WH_SECRET=${WH_SECRET} \
            -p 5000:5000 \
            --name protect_main_branch \
            ghcr.io/zettayottaorg/task
```


To start docker image with customized configurations,

* Create a new directory called configs and add 2 files
  * config.ini
  * branch_config.json
* You can map local configs directory to /apps/configs in docker container

To start docker, run

```apache
docker run -d \
            -e GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN} \
            -e USER=${USER}  \
            -e WH_SECRET=${WH_SECRET} \
            -p 5000:5000 \
            -v /tmp/configs:/apps/configs \
            --name protect_main_branch \
            ghcr.io/zettayottaorg/task
```

Sample of config.ini

```apache
[DEFAULT]
api_url = https://api.github.com
```

Sample of branch_config.json

```apache
{
    "required_status_checks": null,
    "enforce_admins": null,
    "required_pull_request_reviews" : {
        "dismissal_restrictions": {},        
        "require_code_owner_reviews": true,
        "dismiss_stale_reviews": false,
        "required_approving_review_count": 1
    },
    "restrictions": null
}
```
